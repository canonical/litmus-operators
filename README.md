# litmus-operators

This repository hosts Kubernetes charms that automate deploying and operating the Chaos control and execution planes of [LitmusChaos](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus), an open source platform for chaos testing.
 
The charm in `./auth` deploys and operates an authentication server, which is responsible for authorizing and authenticating the requests received from ChaosCenter and managing users along with their projects.
