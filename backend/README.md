This directory contains the source code for a Charmed Operator that partially drives [LitmusChaos] on Kubernetes. It is designed to work together with other charms to deploy and operate the control plane of LitmusChaos, an open source platform for chaos testing.


## Usage

Assuming you have access to a bootstrapped Juju controller on Kubernetes, you can:

```bash
$ juju deploy litmus-backend-k8s # --trust (use when cluster has RBAC enabled)
```
